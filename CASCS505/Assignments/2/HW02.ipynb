    "# CS 505 Homework 02:  Data Wrangling and BOW\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Due Thursday  9/21 at midnight (1 minute after 11:59 pm) in Gradescope (with a grace period of 6 hours)\n",
    "#### You may submit the homework up to 24 hours late (with the same grace period) for a penalty of 10%. \n",
    "\n",
    "All homeworks will be scored with a maximum of 100 points; point values are given\n",
    "for individual problems, and if parts of problems do not have point values given, they\n",
    "will be counted equally toward the total for that problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I strongly recommend you work in **Google Colab** (the free version) to complete homeworks in this class; in addition to (probably) being faster than your laptop, all the necessary libraries will already be available to you, and you don't have to hassle with <code>conda</code>, <code>pip</code>, etc. and resolving problems when the install doesn't work. But it is up to you!   You should go through the necessary tutorials listed on the web site concerning Colab and storing files on a Google Drive. And of course, Dr. Google is always ready to help you resolve your problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will post a  \"walk-through\" video ASAP on my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfSqNB0yh99yuG4p4nzjPOA\">Youtube Channel</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submission Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "You must complete the homework by editing <b>this notebook</b> and submitting the following two files in Gradescope by the due date and time:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A file <code>HW02.ipynb</code> (be sure to select <code>Kernel -> Restart and Run All</code> before you submit, to make sure everything works); and\n",
    "  - A file <code>HW02.pdf</code> created from the previous.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  For best results obtaining a clean PDF file on the Mac, select <code>File -> Print Review</code> from the Jupyter window, then choose <code>File-> Print</code> in your browser and then <code>Save as PDF</code>.  Something  similar should be possible on a Windows machine -- just make sure it is readable and no cell contents have been cut off. Make it easy to grade!\n",
    "  \n",
    "The date and time of your submission is the last file you submitted, so if your IPYNB file is submitted on time, but your PDF is late, then your submission is late. "

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to practice converting raw (string form) text into a useful data set using the script of *Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl* (2003), the first in a series of PotC movies starring Johnny Depp. The script is part of the `webtext` corpus in NLTK. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under the assumption that we wish to perform an analysis of the words spoken by the characters in the movie, we will convert the text in a series of steps from a raw string of ASCII characters into a dictionary holding a sparse BOW model of the words spoken by two of the main characters, Elizabeth Swann and Jack Sparrow. These dictionaries could be the data set for a classification task, or for creating a vector-space model for each character, which we will study later in the course. For this assignment, you will clean  up, normalize and tokenize the text, create the dictionaries, and then simply print out the most common words spoken by the\n",
    "two characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text normalization was covered in lecture on Tuesday 9/12 and the BOW model on Thursday 9/14. Before beginning the assignment, you should \n",
    "consult the following for information on using the Python regular expression library:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Also useful is\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html\n",
    "\n",
    "After reviewing the basic principles of regular expressions (which I will review in my walk-through video), read about the following useful functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    result = re.split(...)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    result = re.sub(...)\n",
    "    \n",
    "You may ONLY use standard functions from the `re` library for this homework,   and you must\n",
    "perform your normalization starting with the string form of the script assigned below to the variable `pirates_txt`. You may NOT use indices of the string to perform your modifications (e.g., deleting the first line by counting how many characters to remove). \n",
    "\n",
    "The point here is to use regular expressions to do the text wrangling. Don't worry, \n",
    "we shall use the `SpaCy` library later on the course to normalize text for a classification problem set. "
