It is possible that GFS clients can read stale data since GFS system can take time to update the files to all replicas. By default, GFS stores identical files within different locations of the server. When a user updates one of the files in GFS, another user can see the outdated version of the same file (which is reading a stale file) if the update has not occurred in the replicas of that file.
