Computation skew refers to the inequality of work done by the 'workers' (some input keys matched with larger amount of data compared to other input keys) in a MapReduce job, which could lead to an inefficient program due to the long run time. To prevent such occurrence, users can evenly distribute the work by using the partitioning function (hashing) and use the combiner function that completes partial merging of data to reduce repetition in the intermediate keys.
