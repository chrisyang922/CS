The Dynamo will still operate correctly in the situation described in the question. According to the paper, it eventually maintains a consistent view since nodes contact a peer chosen randomly and they reconcile their persisted membership change histories. In addition, when S1 is removed, the reallocation of keys happens, which allows the system to continue operating even though it may take some time to become into a consistent state.
