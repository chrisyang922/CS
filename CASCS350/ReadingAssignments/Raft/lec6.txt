When new leader election begins, the servers marked (a) and (d) can be selected as the new leader but the server (f) cannot the leader. For server (a), the servers that would vote for server (a) are itself, (b), and (c), which is three servers out of six, passing the majority rule of election. For server (d), the servers that would for vote for server (d) are itself, (a), (b), (c), and (e), which is five servers out of six, also passing the majority rule of election. For server (f), it would not receive any vote other than itself since all servers ranging from (a) to (e) have higher term number than (f), which would result from (f) receiving only one out of six vote (from itself) and therefore fails the majority rule.
