Yes it is okay to use weak consistency for social applications as long as user data is not lost during the process of an update. Weak consistency is acceptable since there exist lots of concurrent requests by different users and it is okay if other users do not see the user's changes after some time. 
PNUTS handles the problem of applying updates in opposite order despite the user specifying the sequence of orders. Instead of applying the updates that users request directly into the data, PNUTS provides serializability on a per-record basis by including sequence numbers for all updates and applying the change that has the earliest sequence number.
