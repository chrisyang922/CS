The STEM Fellowship offers students the chance for deep
exploration of their own particular area of interest, while fostering real-world skills
needed for high-level scientific research. Fellows work with faculty and mentors
from area labs and hospitals to design and conduct their own experiments and apply
their research to real-world challenges. Fellows present posters at local and national
science fairs.

I researched about autonomous cars.
